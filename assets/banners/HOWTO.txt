1. Resize the cover image into a 600px by width, and a height divisible by 150px, preferably by an amount equal to your compendiums (150 for 1, 300 for 2, 450 for 3, 600 for 4, 750 for 5, etc.)
2. Cut the cover image into the 600x150 banners. You can use https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter for this.
3. Preferably convert them into an efficient format like webp.
4. Assign these images to your compendiums module.json. Make sure they are in the right order or you will get a mismatched image.
